Udemy Data Science Course

These are my solutions to the [Udemy Data Science Course:
Complete Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/).
The course makes heavy use of Microsoft Excel. However, I'm more interested in
the Python equivalent code for all the exercises. I'm sharing this code in the
hope that it's useful to others who take the course.
