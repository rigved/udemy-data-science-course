# $ Parts
* [Part 2: Probability](https://github.com/rigved/udemy-data-science-course/tree/master/part2_probability):
    * Generated probability distribution graphs for the given data using Python.
    * Used these graphs to detect patterns in the data.
* [Part 3: Statistics](https://github.com/rigved/udemy-data-science-course/tree/master/part3_statistics):
    * Generated histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and paretto charts to detect patterns in the given data.
    * Calculated confidence intervals and performed hypothesis testing for various scenarios:
        * Population variance is known for a single sample.
        * Population variance is unknown for a single sample.
        * Population variance is unknown for two dependant samples.
        * Population variance is known for two independent samples.
        * Population variance is unknown but assumed to be equal for two independent samples.
    * Used these techniques on practical examples:
        * Determined if a company has gender bias.
        * Predicted the amount of product inventory required for each store of a multi-national company.
